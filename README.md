kobo-grive-sync
===============

**Note! This hack doesn't work with latest kobo firmware (2.6.1 version and later versions)**

Scripts for automatic Google Drive synchronization on Kobo Touch. Depends on kobo-grive.

Here is a full package that contains grive and its dependencies (from kobo-grive) and the scripts:
https://googledrive.com/host/0B8PUwax9miFkU3lBVXM0dFY3TzA/packages/kobo-grive-sync/KoboRoot.tgz

Curl needs root certificates so the package contains root certificates downloaded from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem

Please read https://github.com/softapalvelin/kobo-grive-sync/wiki/install on how to use the package.
